## What is Tesseract?
Tesseract is an Open Source Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Originally developed by HP in the 1980s as proprietary software, its been open source for nearly 20 years now. It is still undergoing development and is currently sponsored by Google. 

Normally Tesseract is a command line based tool used to identify words/characters present in a single image. This program allows you to use it to identify the text in one or several images, by choosing between the modes. 
## How do I use this?
To use this application, you must first download Tesseract.

There are several ways to do this, two recommended ways are:

  a. Download and compile it [directly](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract "This is a bit more complex")

  b. Download it from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-Windows "Much simpler")

***it is also available for macOS and Linux, these processes are outlined [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/)***
