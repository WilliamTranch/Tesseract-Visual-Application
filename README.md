## What is Tesseract?

## How do I use this?
To use this application, you must first download Tesseract.
There are several ways to do this, two recommended ways are:
a. Download and compile it [directly](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract "This is a bit more complex")
b. Download it from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-Windows "Much simpler")
***note that most Linux distros come with it pre-installed***
